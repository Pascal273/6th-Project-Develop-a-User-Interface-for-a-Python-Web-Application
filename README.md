# Introduction

This is the 4th project for the Python path of Openclassrooms.
The goal is to Develop a a User Interface for a Python Web Application.

# Required setup to run the index.html

For this project, a local version of the OCMovies API has to be installed and run so the website has acces to the data within the API.
This code repository can be found here: `https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/OCMovies-API-EN-FR.git`.
The README file that is present in the repo explains what you need to know to install the dependencies and to launch the server.

# How to run the website:

1. Follow the instructions of the README in the API repo and install and run the Api.
2. The files: `index.html`, `styles.css` and `scripts.js` have to be in the same directory.
3. Open the `index.html` in the browser.
